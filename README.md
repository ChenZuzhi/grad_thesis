**Authors:** Boyu Zhou, Xin He and Zhongyi Zhou, all from [School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://me.sjtu.edu.cn/).

The structure of this project can be unfolded as follows:

- image_retraining:

- trained_model:

- interface:

- gui:

- evaluation:

- preprocess:

- util:

## 2.Prerequisities
  Our testing environment: **Ubuntu** 16.04.

  We use **Tensorflow** to implement main part of our algorithm. 
  
  **OpenCV** is used to do some image pre-processing.

  **PyQt** is also used for creating graphical user interface(GUI). 

## 3.Train your models using transfer learning
